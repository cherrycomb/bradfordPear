This map is based off my Master's thesis research on the cultural and historical biogeography of *Pyrus calleryana* cultivars, trees popularly planted in the southern region during a time of white suburbanization. 

## data sources
Tree data visualized in this map comes from Charlotte's official [urban canopy inventory](https://pg-cloud.com/CharlotteNC/).  

Decennial census data for Mecklenburg county comes from the [City of Charlotte Open Data Portal](https://data.charlottenc.gov/datasets/charlotte::census-tracts-2010-historical-2/about).
